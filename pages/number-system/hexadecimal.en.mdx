|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 8 |
| 9 | 9 |
| a / A| 10 |

## Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion

Your grandfather gifted you a remote control car & your mother gave you a challenge to figure out, how much it costs ?
Otherwise you can't play with that car. Your mother gave you this hint: Price amount is "3E8" in Hexadecimal. 
How much rupees did it cost?

> As we know the value of the car is "3E8" in Hexadecimal (Ox3E8), we have to convert it in decimal.

> Let's evaluate the absolute values: <br/>
> Absolute value of Ox8 in Ox3E8 is 8 <br/>
> Absolute value of OxE in Ox3E8 is 14 <br/>
> Absolute value of Ox3 in Ox3E8 is 3

> Let's evaluate the base values: <br/>
> Base value of Ox8 in Ox3E8 is $16^0$ = 1 <br/>
> Base value of OxE in Ox3E8 is $16^1$ = 16 <br/>
> Base value of Ox3 in Ox3E8 is $16^2$ = {16*16}

> Let's evaluate the place values, now: <br/>
> Place value of Ox8 in Ox3E8 is $ 8 \times 1 $ = 8 <br/>
> Place value of OxE in Ox3E8 is $ 14 \times 16 $ = {14*16} <br/>
> Place value of Ox3 in Ox3E8 is $ 3 \times 256 $ = {3*256}

> So, the decimal value of Ox3E8 is 768 + 224 + 8 = {768 + 224 + 8}

> Now surprise your mother by shouting "1000 Rupees". Then, snatch the car & play with it!

## Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion
In programming, while developing some user interface, you may need to define the color of an element.
For that purpose Hexadecimal numbers (Color Codes) are used instead of decimal number.
For example
