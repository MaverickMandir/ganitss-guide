# Hexadecimal Number System

The Number system uses 16 bases and commonly used in programming.

| Hexadecimal Digit | Equivalent Decimal Values |
|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 8 |
| 9 | 9 |
| a / A| 10 |
| b / B | 11 |
| c / C | 12 |
| d / D | 13 |
| e / E | 14 |
| f / F | 15 |

<Callout type="info" >
  **Hexadecimal Number** uses $16^x$ as base value instead of $10^x$ like we use in decimal number.

## Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion

Your grandfather gifted you a remote control car & your mother gave you a challenge to figure out, how much it costs ?
Otherwise you can't play with that car. Your mother gave you this hint: Price amount is "3E8" in Hexadecimal. 
How much rupees did it cost?

> As we know the value of the car is "3E8" in Hexadecimal (Ox3E8), we have to convert it in decimal.

> Let's evaluate the absolute values: <br/>
> Absolute value of Ox8 in Ox3E8 is 8 <br/>
> Absolute value of OxE in Ox3E8 is 14 <br/>
> Absolute value of Ox3 in Ox3E8 is 3

> Let's evaluate the base values: <br/>
> Base value of Ox8 in Ox3E8 is $16^0$ = 1 <br/>
> Base value of OxE in Ox3E8 is $16^1$ = 16 <br/>
> Base value of Ox3 in Ox3E8 is $16^2$ = {16*16}

> Let's evaluate the place values, now: <br/>
> Place value of Ox8 in Ox3E8 is $ 8 \times 1 $ = 8 <br/>
> Place value of OxE in Ox3E8 is $ 14 \times 16 $ = {14*16} <br/>
> Place value of Ox3 in Ox3E8 is $ 3 \times 256 $ = {3*256}

> So, the decimal value of Ox3E8 is 768 + 224 + 8 = {768 + 224 + 8}

> Now surprise your mother by shouting "1000 Rupees". Then, snatch the car & play with it!

## Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion

A software engineer is writing a program that will convert decimal numbers to hexadecimal. 
The engineer needs to test the program with a few different numbers. 
What are the hexadecimal equivalents of the decimal numbers 450?

> $ \frac{450}{16}  \implies $ Q1 = 28 and R1 = 2

> $ \frac{28}{16}  \implies $ Q2 = 1 and R2 = 12 = C

> $ \frac{1}{16}  \implies $ Q3 =  0 and R3 = 1

> $ \frac{0}{16}  \implies $ Q4 =  0 and R4 = 0

> 450 = Ox01C2 = Ox1C2
