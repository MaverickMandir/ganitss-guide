# Basic Counting Number

Natural, Whole, Odd, Even, Prime numbers etc.

## Problem type 1

Ram started his journey by walking for one hour, then took a bus for three hours then again started walking for an hour. How long was his journey?

> Ram walked for one hour in the beginning & one hour in end.

> So, he walked for two (2) hours.

> He also took a bus for three (3) hours.

> By adding 2 & 3, gives 5.

> So, his journey was 5 (1+3+1) hour long.

## Problem type 2

Mother kunti asked arjuna to order grocery on an online e-commerce platform with a budget of 1000 rupees. 
The grocery list contains the following:
- 3 Litre of oil (1L costs 100 Rupees Or 100 Rs per a litre)
- 2 litre of milk (50 Rs/Litre)
- One dozen egg (15 Rs/egg)
- A packet of soyabean (120 Rs/pack)

She also told arjuna, he can order an ice-cream for him if there is money left. Can arjuna have his ice-cream ?

> Arjuna has 1000 rs in the beginning.

> Then, he orders 3L oil. Costing: $ 3 \times 100= 300$ rs.

> Now, he has 1000-300 = 700 Rupees left.

> Then, he orders 2L of milk. Costing: $ 2 \times 50 = 100$ rs.

> Now, he has 700-100 = 600 Rupees left.

> Then, he orders 12 (one dozen) eggs. <br/>
> Costing: $ 12 \times 15 = (10 + 2) \times 15 = (10 \times 15) + (2 \times 15) = 150 + 30 = 180 $ rs.

> Now, he has 600-180 = 420 Rupees left.

> Then, he orders a pack of soyabean. Costing: 120 rs.

> Now, he has 420-120 = 300 Rupees left.

> So, yes Arjuna can & will order an icecream 🍦🥳.

## Problem type 3.

Mother sita went to a mall to shop grocery, she noticed there was a discount for chocolate bar combos.
So, she decided she'll buy a chocobar combo as her both child(Lob & Kush) loves chocolate bar. 
There were four type of combos each containing 3,7,13 & 16 chocolate bar respectively.

Which combos should she buy, so that each of her child will have equal number of chocolate bar?

> As 3, 7, 13 are all odd numbers, they are not divisible by two.

> But 16 is a even number & divisible by two.

> So in order to distribute equal number of chocobar, she should buy the chocobar combo of 16.

## Problem type 4.

Uncle Bhisma wanted to buy mangos for his three nephews (Dhritrastra, Pandu & Bidhur).
He was in a hurry, so he had to pick between three packs each containing 19,21,23 mangos respectively.
Which pack should he buy in order to equally distribute mangos among his nephews ?

Which combos should she buy, so that each of her child will have equal number of chocolate bar?

> As 19 & 13 are prime numbers, they are not divisible by three.

> But 21 is not a prime number & divisible by three.

> So in order to distribute equal number of mangos, he should buy the mango pack of 21.
