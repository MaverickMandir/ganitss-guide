## Problem type 1

The students of a class arranged a picnic. 
Each student contributed as many rupees as the number of students in the class. 
If the total contribution is Rs 2500, find total number of student in that class.

> Let the number of students in the class be "n". <br/>
> Therefore, contribution by each student is Rs $ n \times n = n^2  $.

> According to question, $ n^2 $ = 2500

> $ \implies n^2 $ = 2500

> $ \implies n = \sqrt{2500} $ 

> $ \implies n = \sqrt{50 \times 50} $

> $ \implies n $ = 50.
