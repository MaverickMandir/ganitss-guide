The Number system used in computers which only uses 0 and 1.

| Binary Digit | Equivalent Decimal Values |
|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |

<Callout type="info" >
  **Binary Number** uses $2^x$ as base value instead of $10^x$ like we use in decimal number.

## Decimal to Binary Conversion

A software engineer is writing a program that will convert decimal numbers to binary. 
The engineer needs to test the program with a few different numbers. 
What are the binary equivalents of the decimal numbers 45?

> $ \frac{45}{2}  \implies $ Q1 = 22 & R1 = 1

> $ \frac{22}{2}  \implies $ Q2 = 11 & R2 = 0

> $ \frac{11}{2}  \implies $ Q3 = 5 & R3 = 1

> $ \frac{5}{2}  \implies $ Q4 = 2 & R4 = 1

> $ \frac{2}{2}  \implies $ Q5 = 1 & R5 = 0

> $ \frac{1}{2}  \implies $ Q6 = 0 & R6 = 1

> $ \frac{0}{2}  \implies $ Q7 = 0 & R7 = 0

> $ 45_{10} = 0101101_2 $

## Binary to Decimal Conversion

Your grandfather gifted you a chocolate bar & your mother gave you a challenge to figure out, how much it costs ?
Otherwise you can't play with that car. Your mother gave you this hint: Price amount is $ 1110_2 $ in binary. 
How much rupees did it cost?

> As we know the value of the car is $ 1110_2 $ in binary, we have to convert it in decimal.

> $ \implies (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (0 \times 2^0) $

> $ \implies (1 \times 8) + (1 \times 4) + (1 \times 2) + (0 \times 1) $

> $ \implies 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 $

> $ \implies 14 $

> Now surprise your mother by shouting 14 Rupees. Then, snatch the chocolate bar & eat it!
